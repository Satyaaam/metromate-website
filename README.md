# MetroMate - Your Metro Route Finder

MetroMate is a web application that helps users find the best routes for their metro journeys. This README provides an overview of the project, how to set it up locally, and how to contribute to its development.

## About MetroMate

MetroMate is designed to simplify metro travel by providing users with route suggestions, station information, and more. It offers the following features:

- **Route Planning**: Easily plan your metro route from one station to another, including transfer points and estimated travel time.
